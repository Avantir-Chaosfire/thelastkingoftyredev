To Do List:

Foreword:
	Brainstorm:
		-Redstone/blood textures overlap in a way that seems hardcoded, can it be fixed?
		-Perjurer backstab damage threshold can be randomly crossed by arrow crits?
		-Spiders in general like to hug walls instead of attacking the player
		-Man-Bulls roar can blast you way into the air
		-Starving reapers sometimes take more than 22 damage to kill (e.g. 1 full bow shot + 2 greatsword strikes) - cave spiders too
			-Possible explanations:
				-They were healed
				-You had weakness
				-You were using Heart of the Golem
				-You were using Tower Shield
				-You didn't fully draw back the bow
		-Crystal Guardian names are never visible (they have invisibility) and they can't directly kill you, so it doesn't show up in death messages either.
		-Could put books on lecterns. Has the issue that lectern contents cannot be generated via a loot table.

	Indefinitely postponed:
*		-Probably need to trim out extra chunks/entities that I generated when testing Arc Lightning
		-Punching bags stick around after leaving tutorial, if you return without dying
		-Oogieface had one of the two final Dread Hosts in the shade caster fight permanently stop spawning
		-Giant Spider Fang slow doesn't work with Radiant set equipped
		-Phantom Javelin looks like a trident in hand and when thrown

	Release Procedure:
		-Make backup
		-Clear ender chest
		-Verify difficulty is locked to normal, not easy
		-dev:reset/new_game
		-Run around everywhere to generate the loot table and respawn npcs and update chunks
		-dev:reset/release
		-Enable command output
		-Run "/fill -881 0 -753 -896 5 -768 glowstone replace minecraft:granite" to check if any loot tables are not generated
		-Check all player tags (UpdateXX_XX, ActiveScroll, etc.)
		-Disable command output
		-Remove dev functions (Remove references in minecraft function tags)
		-Zip up data pack
		-Launch a copy of the world on the server and see if loading the data pack gives any error messages
		-Disable cheats
		-Set Time to 0
		-Rename save file to remove "[Dev]"
