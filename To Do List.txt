To Do List:

Foreword:
	Brainstorm:
		-Redstone/blood textures overlap in a way that seems hardcoded, can it be fixed?
		-Perjurer backstab damage threshold can be randomly crossed by arrow crits?
		-Spiders in general like to hug walls instead of attacking the player
		-Man-Bulls roar can blast you way into the air
		-Starving reapers sometimes take more than 22 damage to kill (e.g. 1 full bow shot + 2 greatsword strikes) - cave spiders too
			-Possible explanations:
				-They were healed
				-You had weakness
				-You were using Heart of the Golem
				-You were using Tower Shield
				-You didn't fully draw back the bow

	Indefinitely postponed:
*		-Probably need to trim out extra chunks/entities that I generated when testing Arc Lightning
		-Punching bags stick around after leaving tutorial, if you return without dying
		-Oogieface had one of the two final Dread Hosts in the shade caster fight permanently stop spawning
		-Giant Spider Fang slow doesn't work with Radiant set equipped

	Release Procedure:
		-Make backup
		-Clear ender chest
		-Verify difficulty is locked to normal, not easy
		-dev:reset/new_game
		-Run around everywhere to generate the loot table and respawn npcs and update chunks
		-dev:reset/release
		-Enable command output
		-Run "/fill -881 0 -753 -896 5 -768 glowstone replace minecraft:granite" to check if any loot tables are not generated
		-Check all player tags (UpdateXX_XX, ActiveScroll, etc.)
		-Disable command output
		-Remove dev functions (Remove references in minecraft function tags)
		-Zip up data pack (On Windows, direct files only (Not containing folder), remove .DS_Store files beforehand)
		-Launch a copy of the world on the server and see if loading the data pack gives any error messages
		-Check there's only one copy of every npc
		-Disable cheats
		-Set Time to 0
		-Rename save file to remove "[Dev]"

	Post-Release:
		-Intangible reapers take damage from the Heavy Battle Axe
		-Iron guard reapers should only gain speed from 3+ damage
		-Ashen Talisman doesn't indicate health requirement
		-Sac Knife & New Prophet absorption don't work thanks to challenge knight set - should only clear absorption when you lose the tag and don't get it back
		-You can permanently lose items in map item frames in Enshadowed Thrones
		-Can attack with Life Bane at <5 stamina
		-crystal guardian name tag visibility
		-Fireball gives True Assassin achievement
		-spyglass in astrologist's loft
		-More distinct sprite for fountain water full/empty
		-balance changes
			-nerf desolate
		-returning to lobby on new prophet ending?
			-also endings force activate death sigil, which kind of breaks useless emissary
		-Hanging Pole fight didn't start that one time
		-banners are messed up
		-bossbar textures
		-shulker texture not working

		Level design:
			-moving tyre reaches key?
			-glowering mines more obvious
			-Give Desiccating Carapaces for defeating Shade Caster in addition to button
			-psych ward parkour
			-vanishing key shortcut
			-bcg skip via that big shaft in new hoiro
