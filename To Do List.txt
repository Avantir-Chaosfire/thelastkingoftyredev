To Do List:

Foreword:
	Brainstorm:
		-Redstone/blood textures overlap in a way that seems hardcoded, can it be fixed?
		-Perjurer backstab damage threshold can be randomly crossed by arrow crits?
		-Spiders in general like to hug walls instead of attacking the player
		-Man-Bulls roar can blast you way into the air
		-Starving reapers sometimes take more than 22 damage to kill (e.g. 1 full bow shot + 2 greatsword strikes) - cave spiders too
			-Possible explanations:
				-They were healed
				-You had weakness
				-You were using Heart of the Golem
				-You were using Tower Shield
				-You didn't fully draw back the bow

	Indefinitely postponed:
*		-Probably need to trim out extra chunks/entities that I generated when testing Arc Lightning
		-Punching bags stick around after leaving tutorial, if you return without dying
		-Oogieface had one of the two final Dread Hosts in the shade caster fight permanently stop spawning
		-Giant Spider Fang slow doesn't work with Radiant set equipped

	Release Procedure:
		-Make backup
		-Clear ender chest
		-Verify difficulty is locked to normal, not easy
		-dev:reset/new_game
		-Run around everywhere to generate the loot table and respawn npcs and update chunks
		-dev:reset/release
		-Enable command output
		-Run "/fill -881 0 -753 -896 5 -768 glowstone replace minecraft:granite" to check if any loot tables are not generated
		-Check all player tags (UpdateXX_XX, ActiveScroll, etc.)
		-Disable command output
		-Remove dev functions (Remove references in minecraft function tags)
		-Zip up data pack (On Windows, direct files only (Not containing folder), remove .DS_Store files beforehand)
		-Launch a copy of the world on the server and see if loading the data pack gives any error messages
		-Check there's only one copy of every npc
		-Disable cheats
		-Rename save file to remove "[Dev]"

	Post-Release:
		-Intangible reapers take damage from the Heavy Battle Axe
		-Iron guard reapers should only gain speed from 3+ damage
		-Ashen Talisman doesn't indicate health requirement
		-Sac Knife & New Prophet absorption don't work thanks to challenge knight set - should only clear absorption when you lose the tag and don't get it back
		-You can permanently lose items in map item frames in Enshadowed Thrones
		-Can attack with Life Bane at <5 stamina
		-ashen talisman tooltip
		-crystal guardian name tag visibility
		-Fireball gives True Assassin achievement

			-psych ward parkour
			-vanishing key shortcut

Upgrading:
	1.15 Changes Required:
		-Full re-test of Disgraceful Beast fight (Slimes/Magma Cubes now use attributes)
		-Locked chest texture broken
		-Enchantment glint texture broken
		-Remove arrow particles (Kurnas, Hanging Pole, Kiermert, local_event/arrow_trap, local_event/blood_sigil_tutorial, one_second/local_event/arrow_trap)
		-Data pack version changed to 5 (or 6 or 7?)
		-Resource pack version changed to 5 (or 6 or 7?)
		-Commands executing "if block" checks every tick are keeping chunks loaded. "if block" checks need preconditions to limit their checks and allow the chunks to unload. This must respect the ability to reset the map during the release process.
		-Living Mass laser beam is mostly invisible
			-May need to edit "Time" in level.dat - see MC-165595

	1.16 Changes Required:
		-Update all attribute names
		-Change all references to "zombie_pigman" to "zombified_piglin"
		-Change all single drop blood splatters to dots, so the texture doesn't overlap with itself
		-Investigate interaction of shulkers/stone guardians pushing spawn points (Due to a bug, they can push marker armor stands) [Fixed in 1.17]
		-Change nose and ears of zombified piglin texture to be invisible, and fix the Noble Reaper texture
		-Set gamerule forgiveDeadPlayers true
		-Set gamerule universalAnger false

	1.17 Notes:
		-shulkers can spawn other shulkers by attacking each other
		-maximum slime size is 128
		-variable world height
		-chain block
		-bug regarding ungenerated loot - make sure loot table reset, even when chest contents are present, works and doesn't drop items (MC-225394)
