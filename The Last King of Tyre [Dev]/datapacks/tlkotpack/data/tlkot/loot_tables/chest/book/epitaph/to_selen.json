I do hope you read this. These are my final moments of awareness before the end.

Do I regret my choice? No. No, it was the right choice, and it is not my choice that I question, but rather my reasoning. You see,\",\"my life is not an altogether precious commodity, so when I die my work and my name will be lost to the mists of time.

Unless, of course, I do something worth remembering.

Good luck to you, and goodbye.\"]}"
