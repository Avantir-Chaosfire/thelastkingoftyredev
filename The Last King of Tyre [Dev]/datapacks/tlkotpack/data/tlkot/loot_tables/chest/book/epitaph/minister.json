Once, I was against war. I thought those who practiced it were wrong, that they were not like me...

When my son chose to become a soldier, and fight in the undead crusades, I disowned him. Now I write this\",\"last note, here to sacrifice my own life, and it is he who refuses to leave my side.

I, who preached love and forgiveness, have failed to follow those teachings. My own son, whom I believed myself so superior to... He has done better than I.\",\"What a fool I was. Now I have a chance to change, and I choose to die.

Isn't that just the easy way out?

So do I believe what I preached? Or am I just hollow inside? If so, I am not alone.

To you, who journeys\",\"this accursed path, do not join me in my depths of defeat. Seek strength, seek love, seek... Something greater, else you will find yourself on a hanging pole.

Too much like me.\"]}"
