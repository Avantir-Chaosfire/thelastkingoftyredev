He expected it to be complicated, but it was even more so than he\",\"had expected. Having mistakenly announced his project before it was ready, he was pressured by peasants and nobles alike, particularly those with injured family or friends, to finish as fast as possible. The result of his hasty work was the Kshji Blood Sigil, Class 4, which was\",\"later imprinted into a scroll (Illegally of course). It killed twenty-two of the twenty-five people he cast it on. As a direct result, he was executed and the newly named sub-form of Kshji was forbidden. However, nearly all Kshji to date has been based off of his original\",\"work.

Only in recent years, when humanity finally reached the northern continent, was the class 5 variation of the Blood Sigil Scroll discovered in the deep southern isles. It was found buried in the floor of an underground chamber, where it had clearly\",\"been hidden for some time, though not terribly long. Whoever hid it could very well still be alive today. The group that discovered it handed it over to be researched and destroyed, though they took long enough that many suspect they may have created duplicates.\",\"The casters that researched and destroyed it refuse (For good reason) to explain how it works, but they did tell the wider world what it did.

In discussing these variations of the infamous Blood Sigil, it is important to note the difference between classes 4\",\"and 5. Class 4 scrolls never require direct interaction with the soul, but class 5 scrolls do, making them much more potent to everyone involved.

Both variations of the Blood Sigil carve the symbol for blood onto one's inner right forearm. The class 5 additionally carves\",\"the symbol for death into one's left palm (Note that the locations of both sigils can vary depending on one's handedness and missing limbs).

The Blood Sigil has two states: Dormant and Linked. It is ordinarily dormant, but when the bearer is injured, it\",\"begins to glow, becoming linked to the one who caused the injury. It stays linked for a short period of time before losing its connection and glow and becoming dormant again.

Injury, it appears, is considered to be internal or external bleeding. The one who\",\"caused the injury is determined by a variety of heuristics in tracking energy flows, and is a very complicated process.

When one holds their touch to their linked Blood Sigil for a short moment, it activates. Activation injures the bearer further (Hence the frequent\",\"killing), but then draws energy from the one lined to in order to heal the wound inflicted on the bearer.

The functional difference between the class 4 and 5 variants of the Blood Sigil is that the class 4 variant can only be activated while linked,\",\"but the class 5 variant can also be activated while dormant by pressing the Death Sigil against the head of the Blood Sigil and holding it their for a second or two, in which case the Blood Sigil links to the bearer, which not only kills the bearer, but alters the state of their soul. This\",\"process could supposedly render undead inert, but would, of course, require casting a difficult and forbidden scroll on them in close proximity over a period of time, which is entirely impractical.\"]}"
