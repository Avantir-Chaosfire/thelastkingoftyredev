But less well known is when the dread are able to alter a person's physiology without inserting a nerve stem, creating\",\"an independent person wholly dedicated to the benefit of the dread. Such, people, called Dread Hosts, are very rare, but are all the more deadly for it.

Owing to the variety of performance-enhancing drugs the dread inject them with, Dread\",\"Hosts are faster and stronger than regular people, can float, pass through walls and easily learn new scrolls to cast. Furthermore, they are nearly invulnerable to any regular attack, making them very difficult to kill even for a group of prepared warriors. Their one weakness is\",\"their back, where the dread inject them. There, regular attacks can hurt a Dread Host, but only if aimed carefully from right behind.

Dread Hosts have escaped from the Dreadwoods a handful of times over the years, each time requiring a group of\",\"expert casters and veteran knights to kill. Only one person has ever defeated a Dread Host alone, and that was the Fleeting Lich, who was trapped in a room with one in an effort to stop him.

Proper research has never been conducted on a Dread Host, because they have\",\"never complied, nor would they ever, and no effort to contain them has succeeded. It's also worth noting that no effort to escape a Dread Host has ever succeeded either.\"]}"
