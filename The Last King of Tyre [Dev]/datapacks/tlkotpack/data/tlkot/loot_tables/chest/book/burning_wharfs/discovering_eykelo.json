And amongst them saw I my friend Eykelo.

'Eykelo', said I, 'In this line, why this spot?'\",\"'Eykelo', he replied, 'My name that is not,

But wandering as may your instincts be,

Not so far are they from the truth, you see.'\",\"To his left, he gestured, behold a woman, did I,

'The third', he said, 'The one after I,

My true name originates in my product with she.'\",\"To his right, he gestured, behold a child, did I,

'The first', he said, 'The one before I,

My true name is the sum of our entirety.'\",\"Lost, now I, stepped back to view,

A long line of people who I not knew.

The name, the meaning, I strove to see,\",\"And tilted my head left that I may be

Of a greater perspective and a wiser way

Than those who would grimace, and turn away.\"]}"
