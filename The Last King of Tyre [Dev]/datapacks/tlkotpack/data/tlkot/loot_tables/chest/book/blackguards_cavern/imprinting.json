If you want to create a scroll but don't know how, don't try. Submit your idea to a professional caster and let them do the dangerous work.

If you merely want to\",\"repair an existing scroll, you will need to hold both it and a pre-prepared blank scroll in your hands. Stand over the Scroll Imprinter, and its Aerteyp mechanism will imprint the damaged scroll onto the blank scroll. Do note that the damaged scroll will be destroyed in this process.\",\"If these instructions are unclear or if you have a special circumstance, ask a professional caster.\"]}"
